# Java Code Challenges

This project will be used to store Java Code Challenges worked on my own time.

## About This Repository

The plan is to have many Libraries here along with test libraries, readmes, and other supporting files.

While Gradle treats this repository as a single project, it is just a container for Library files.

Some libraries will contain core algorithm and data structures, others will contain code that relies on those core structures, completing a code challenge using them.

## Index of Libraries

The following index links to readme files specific for each data structure and code challenge in the base library.

- [ ] [Linked Lists]()
- [ ] [Stacks and Queues]()
- [ ] [Trees](docs/readme-trees.md)
- [ ] [Hash Tables]()
