# Hashtables

Overview of Hashtables datastructure, and how to use them in an algorithm.

## Terminology

- Hash: Take an incoming String and convert it into a numeric value. Could be used for security or as a key-index to a table.
- Buckets: Abstract containers located at each index of the hashtable array. Multiple key/value pairs can be stored in each Bucket as collisions occur.
- Collisions: More than one key gets hashed to the same numeric value. For a Hashtable, this means the values will be placed in the same hashtable array index or Bucket.

## Purpose

Use hashtables to hold *unique* values, or as storage for dictionary items, or libraries of entries.
